Dear all,

Please find below assignment 2 for Compilers Lab.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem1 (a).
Take a language which is a subset of C. You may take any other language
(or its subset). Define its alphabets and the tokens using regular
expressions. From the tokens, generate the transition diagrams and display
them in form of a table.
Take a sample program in the language you have considered. Perform lexical
analysis for the program and generate the symbol table. Also, your lexical
analysis module should have error detection capability.


The problem defined above describes ONLY the basic requirements. You are
free to implement in your own way for efficiency in implementation,
however, you must remember that computation power should not be more than
that of DFA.
Extra credits will be given for “efficiency in implementation”!!!!


Problem1 (b).
Implement a Lexical analyzer using lex for the same language language
considered above.
